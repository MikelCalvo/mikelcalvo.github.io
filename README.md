# Mikel Calvo's Personal Website

This is the source code for my personal website, hosted on GitHub Pages. The website serves as a hub for my professional and personal activities, providing links to my projects, books I've read, and ways to contact me.

## Credits

The website design is based on the "Identity" template by HTML5 UP. HTML5 UP provides free, responsive HTML5 and CSS3 website templates. You can check out their work at [html5up.net](https://html5up.net/). The template is free for personal and commercial use under the CCA 3.0 license.

Special thanks to [@ajlkn](https://aj.lkn.io/) for creating these amazing templates.
